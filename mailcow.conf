# Security
# Set to 'y' to enable two-factor authentication for the UI
# Tfa is managed in the UI, but this ensures support

# CLOUDFLARE SPECIFIC (Optional but Recommended)
# If you want to use Cloudflare DNS API for certificates (avoids port 80 issues)
# You will need to add these to your mailcow.conf on the server:
# CF_Email=your-cloudflare-email
# CF_Key=your-cloudflare-api-key (Global Key or specific Token)
# If using the above, you can often keep DNS proxied for UI only, 
# but GREY CLOUD is still required for SMTP/IMAP.
